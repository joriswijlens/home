# Home

This repository contains all the code and documentation for my home automation.

Main goals:
- zero emission
- comfort in smart automation

In the diagram you can see my setup

## Approach

### At first
- Start with a production environment only
- Deploy from my own laptop
    
### Later
- Introduce VPN to access the home network from outside
- Introduce a test environment
- Deploy from a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
