# Initial Architecture

## Context
We are building a home automation system with Home Assistant and Raspberry Pi. 
We want it to be maintainable, cost effective, reliable, and support smart devices easily.

## Decision
We will use an SSD for storage on our Raspberry Pi running Home Assistant with Docker. 

## Consequences
- More reliable and faster storage compared to SD cards.
- Increased cost and complexity.
