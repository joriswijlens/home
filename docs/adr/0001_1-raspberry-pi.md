# Initial Architecture

## Context
We are building a home automation system with Home Assistant and Raspberry Pi. 
We want it to be maintainable, cost effective, reliable, and support smart devices easily.

## Decision
We will use Home Assistant installed on a Raspberry Pi with Docker.

## Consequences
- We benefit from a large community and lots of integrations.
- We rely on the stability of the Raspberry Pi and Home Assistant updates.
- Inside our home
