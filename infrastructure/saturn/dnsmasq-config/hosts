# This file is not currently used
# dnsmasq forwards all DNS queries to the KPN router (192.168.2.254)
# which automatically resolves local hostnames

# If you need to override specific hostnames, you can add them here
# and mount this file in docker-compose.yml with:
#   - ./dnsmasq-config/hosts:/etc/dnsmasq-hosts/hosts:ro
# Then add to dnsmasq.conf:
#   addn-hosts=/etc/dnsmasq-hosts/hosts
